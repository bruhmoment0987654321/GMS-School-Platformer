I would like to thank all the people who have playtested my game:

	369071 2458
	Jason Pelkey
	









And to the people that I have come across who have helped me in this journey:

	Mr.Winikka - very cool teacher, helpful and kinda gave me the idea for this game
	
	Jason Pelkey - A fellow coder in his game SE/N/SE. They have worked on it for about a year or 2. Don't remember.
	But they are very smart. And I mean VERY. 
	
	Shawn Spalding - One of the pillars of Game Maker. Without him, none of this code would be possible. He is straight-foward,
	to the point, and informative. His tutorials are great as well. Especially the Complete Platformer Tutorial. Great stuff. 
	
	1up Indie - His videos are pretty well made, with the most useful vids are for his enemy AI.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Thank you to all of you :]
	
	
	
	
	
	Sincerely, Walbert Kyle
